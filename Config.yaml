# --- OCR OPTIONS ---
# ------------------------------
# These have been tuned to the test folder, which is a broad sample of sources.
# The PSM settings detect the layout. The versions are different filters applied to the image to enhance various possible elements.
# All enabled PSMs are tested on whichever versions are enabled as the "first pass" (marked with a 1).
# The best PSM is selected by weighting the confidence tesseract calculates in the lines against how many words it detects from the supplied dictionary.
# That PSM is run on the remaining enabled versions (marked with a 2)
# The versions marked 0 are completely disabled.

ocr:
  enabled_psms:
    0: false   # Orientation and script detection (OSD only, no OCR)
    1: true    # Automatic page segmentation with OSD (general-purpose, strong default)
    2: false   # Automatic segmentation, no OSD or OCR (not implemented / broken)
    3: true    # Fully automatic page segmentation (no OSD; very reliable)
    4: true    # Assume single column of text (excellent for screenshots & memes)
    5: false   # Assume single uniform block of vertically aligned text (rarely useful)
    6: true    # Assume single uniform block of text (best for clean caption blocks)
    7: false   # Treat image as a single text line (too brittle for general use)
    8: false   # Treat image as a single word (only useful for labels / icons)
    9: false   # Treat image as a single word in a circle (very niche)
    10: false  # Treat image as a single character (almost never useful)
    11: true   # Sparse text, find as much as possible (great for memes / posters)
    12: false   # Sparse text with OSD (similar to 11; sometimes slightly better)
    13: false  # Raw line recognition (debug / research only)
    14: false  # Treat image as single text line with OSD (niche)
    15: false  # Sparse text + OSD + vertical text (mostly signage)
    16: false  # Sparse text, no OSD, no orientation (edge-case signage)

  enabled_versions:
    # 0 = disabled
    # 1 = First-Pass Versions: all of these are run and processed under all enabled PSMs
    # 2 = Second-Pass Versions - the rest of these are run and processed only by the PSM that scored the highest on the first 3
    original: 1        # Baseline reference; never disable
    grayscale: 1       # Removes color noise; almost always helps
    autocontrast: 1    # Expands dynamic range; great for memes/screenshots
    resize_2x: 2       # Increases character resolution (critical for small text)
    resize_2x_autocontrast: 2  # Strong combo for low-res screenshots
    denoise_median: 2  # Removes salt-and-pepper noise without killing edges
    adaptive_threshold: 0
      # Converts to black/white using local contrast, Excellent for high-contrast text, terrible for photos (hence optional)
    deskew: 2
      # Corrects rotation from scans / crooked photos Safe because it’s cheap and fails gracefully
    transparency_white_bg: 2
    transparency_black_bg: 0
      # RGBA images get flattened onto solid backgrounds
      # White almost always wins; black is niche but occasionally useful

llm_options:
  llm_model: gemma2:2b
  ocr_cleanup: |
    Focus on OCR-generated text from social media posts, memes, and internet content. Remove most social media background data such as timestamps, likes, or reposts, only keeping names. Remove most non-alphanumeric characters. Correct OCR mistakes and normalize punctuation and whitespace. Remove newlines that cut words or sentences, but keep ones that organize lists, long-form text, or chat-style transcripts. Create full sentences or at least sentence fragments/statements that clearly communicate a concept. Make the text coherent for use with a screen reader. Act as an editor and return only the edited text without commentary.
  llm_tagging: | # this is a list of reference tags it will use to attempt to categorize the outputs. This can be added to / customized if your set includes specific media, topics, etc.

    No punctuation, no explanations, no extra text.
